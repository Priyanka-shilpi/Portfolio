      Hi! I’m PRIYANKA SHILPI, a passionate and driven software developer currently looking for my first opportunity in the tech industry.
       I’ve recently graduated, and I’m eager to apply my skills in frontend development and web technologies to create impactful and user-friendly applications.
      
      During my academic journey,I worked on various projects, including a sign language recognition system and a web security project. These experiences helped
    
      me develop a strong foundation in programming languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React.
      
      I’m constantly learning and growing, especially in areas like data science, and I’m excited to take on new challenges in my career.
